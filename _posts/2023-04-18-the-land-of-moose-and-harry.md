In the land of Moose and Harry,
<br>Two friends rode with hearts so merry
<br><br>
On their trusty Onewheels, they flew
<br>A way of life they loved, so true
<br><br>
From sunrise to sunset, they'd roam
<br>Exploring new paths and finding home
<br><br>
Their passion for riding knew no bounds
<br>Moose with his girlfriend, Harry unbound
<br><br>
Together they journeyed through the land
<br>With extra batteries, they took a stand
<br><br>
Riding nearly a hundred miles each day
<br>Their Onewheels powering their way
<br><br>
Dreaming of routes yet to be explored
<br>Their minds and hearts fully onboard
<br><br>
Their boards upgraded with chargers so fast
<br>Quickly recharging, they're ready to last
<br><br>
One day they'll ride from coast to coast
<br>Their love for adventure, never to boast
<br><br>
Moose with his girl, Harry the bachelor
<br>Their passion for riding, forever a factor
<br><br>
In the land of Moose and Harry, they roam
<br>A never-ending journey, they call home
<br><br>
Their love for Onewheels, a way of life
<br>Forever exploring, no end in sight.
