Once upon a time there was a perfect project structure. There likely is one in every software engineer’s mind. A ethereal programming wonderland where everything works. Here’s mine:

*Mongo, Express, Node.js, Angular, Mocha, Selenium, CircleCI, EC2, Route53*

Mongo is the database. It’s a really simple, no schema, get it done db

Express is the router for the server built with Node.js

Angular is the frontend framework of the month

Mocha runs the tests

Selenium and WebDriver lets us run the mocha tests against real browsers

CircleCI builds the app, runs the tests against it and then deploys automatically

EC2 is where the app lives in the cloud

Route53 points domains at EC2 instances and routes emails, among other things
